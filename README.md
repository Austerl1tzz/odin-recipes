Finally, I am completing the HTML part of the Foundations Course by TOP. 

As a project, I will complete the simple website with recipes of some dishes. It will be a plain text without any styling. 

I will demonstrate such skills as navigating through the web pages, then creating and structuring of the content and text, HTML basic layout.
